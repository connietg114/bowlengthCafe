                <h3>LAST UPDATED 12/08/2020<br></h3>
                <h3>WE KEEP THIS PAGE UP-TO-DATE WITH THE LATEST NEWS ABOUT WHAT WE DO DURING THE COVID-19 CRISIS. THANK
                    YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND HELP, DON’T FORGET TO STAY SAFE WHILE STAYING BUBBLY!<br><br><br></h3>
                <p></p>
                <p><strong>Dear Customers,</strong><br></p>
                <p>As per the latest Government regulations and alert levels, we are required to
                    bring some safety measures back to the stores, and we are committed to making necessary
                    modifications during this time. <br><br></p>

                <p></p>

                <h2>UPDATE FOR LEVEL 3 </h2>
                <p>At Alert Level 3, our Auckland store will be closed to comply with the shopping centre restriction.
                    However, it will be open under Alert Level 2.<br><br><br></p>
                
                <p></p>
                <p></p>

                <h2>UPDATE FOR LEVEL 2 </h2>
                <p>While Wellington is now on alert level 2, please help us to maintain a safe environment by making
                    sure either scan the check-in QR code or sign in to record your visit at the store. To follow the
                    alert level restriction, limit amount of
                    people entering the store will apply, as well as the social distancing.</p>
                    <p>LowerHutt Store services will be available by <i><strong>front door ONLY</strong></i>, as
                    the store often gets hard to manage at a busy period. <br></p>
                <p>Our main priority during this time is to ensure the health and safety of our amazing community of
                    customers and staff, and we will continue to act with this in mind until we are sure that enjoying
                    Noah’s Ark bubble tea is a risk-free
                    experience. Our team will be sanitising their hands and surfaces as often as possible while serving
                    customers. We will update you on any and all changes to Noah’s Ark as they happen, and we are
                    grateful for your support and cooperation
                    through this trying time. We could not ask for a better community to surround ourselves with and
                    hope you all stay safe and stay bubbly. <br><br><br></p>
                <p></p>

                <p>The Noah’s Ark Team<br><br><br><br></p>

                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>

                <h2>DELIVERY / UBEREATS</h2>
                <p>Food delivery apps are going to be a great way to ensure you can enjoy quality cuisine at home, so we
                    will be jumping back onto UberEats. Our UberEats menu currently only displays our top 20 as we found
                    the interface couldn’t represent
                    our full range in a comprehensive way. However, if you are craving your old favourite then just
                    leave a note on your order and we’ll make anything you like. <br><br>Our menu on UberEats is a bit
                    pricey due to the large surcharge
                    the system imposes. As much as we’d love to take the hit and cut prices, it’s not something we’re
                    able to facilitate at the moment. <br><br>While UberEats does have pick up option, we really
                    encourage and recommend customers to
                    order through Phone Call order if you wish to pick up. So you don’t have to pay extra for UberEats
                    services.<br><br><br></p>
                <p></p>


                <h2>PICK UP (PHONE CALL + UBEREATS)</h2>
                <span>(REGULR APP SERVICES HAS BEEN PAUSED)</span>
                <p>Since Alert Level 3 we have been available on the Regulr online ordering app. This has been an
                    incredibly useful tool for minimising contact over this period, and we think the app itself shows
                    great promise. <br><br></p>
                <p>However, we have received a large amount of feedback from customers have had issues with the app and
                    payment, and so do we. Therefore, we have decided to pause the services on Regulr as the life is now
                    getting back to normal. If you
                    wish to do a pick up order please call us to make an order.<br><br><br></p>
                <p></p>

                <h2>SUPPORTING LOCAL </h2>
                <p>New Zealanders have come together to fight the COVID crisis, but we ask you to continue the effort by
                    buying from New Zealand-based businesses. Our economy has suffered for the sake of public help but
                    buying local helps strengthen
                    our community. Noah’s Ark employs 24 awesome Kiwis, providing bubble tea to thousands of equally
                    awesome Kiwis. We’re one of many businesses that put money back into this country’s economy, hit
                    hard by the crisis. <br><br></p>
                <p>The amazing folks at Gazley Motors began The Gazley Support Local Project to promote Wellington-based
                    businesses, showing where you can buy from to help our community. We would heartily encourage you to
                    give these and other local businesses
                    your support. Wellington is such an amazing city with all its quirky little corners and these
                    organisations help build that brilliant culture. We’ll be promoting this project over the coming
                    months, hoping to help as many people
                    in our community as possible.</p>
