                <h2>BRINGING YOU THE TEAS FROM AFAR.</h2>
                <p>Noah’s Ark Teahouse, the Bubble Tea chain like no other, brings Bubble Tea home to Wellington, New Zealand. Bubble Tea is a delicious East Asian shaken drink, made either with a milky base or tea base, most commonly served with Tapioca
                    pearls. At Noah’s Ark, we take bubble tea and add our own creative twist. We bring our customers classic freshly brewed teas, as well as new flavour inventions created by our proud Bobaristas. At Noah’s Ark, we pride ourselves on giving
                    our customers choice. You can customise our teas with an array of toppings, flavours and drink variety. All of our drinks and toppings are Vegetarian, Dairy-Free and Gluten-Free, with the exception of optional fresh milk (instead of
                    the Soy-based creamer) and ice cream as a topping. There are also sweetness and temperature levels, that are interchangeable to your taste. We truly do have a drink for everyone! </p>
